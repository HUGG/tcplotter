    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is a document that combines rich text formatting (like that in a word processor or website) with programming language code. The notebook itself is divided into blocks called cells that have a defined cell type, which means a cell can either contain rich text, code, or raw unformatted text (but not a mix). For us, the main concern will be code cells and how to run them, as that will be the way to produce a plot.\n",

    "\n",
    "To run a code cell, simply click on the cell containing code and press one of the following key combinations:\n",

    "- <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> or \n",
    "- <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>return</kbd>\n",

This means you may lose any progress you have made in the notebook after this time elapses. If you want to keep your session alive, be sure to run at least one code cell every 10 minutes. Once the session dies...\n",
